# JavaScript Concepts

## Events 

- Up till now we have used major times the `click` event, but what are actually events? in JavaScript, events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, which can be detected and responded to using code. Think of events as things that users or the system might do, like clicking a button, pressing a key, or loading a webpage. JavaScript can listen for these events and react by running specific functions, often called event handlers.
- Events can be triggered by various user interactions or by the browser itself.
